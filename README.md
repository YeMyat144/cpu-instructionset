# CPU Instruction Set

This project is a Python-based simulation of an instruction set for a hypothetical CPU. It supports various operations (e.g., `mov`, `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`) and emulates register-based computations, including decoding, encoding, and pipeline execution.

## Features

- **Instruction Set Operations**: Supports `mov`, `add`, `sub`, `mul`, and `div` instructions.
- **Register Management**: Simulates 8 general-purpose registers (`r0` to `r7`) with addressable values.
- **Binary Encoding**: Converts instruction sets and register values to binary formats.
- **Clock Cycle Simulation**: Tracks execution cycles for each operation.
- **Pipeline Execution**: Simulates instruction execution in a pipelined manner.
- **Program Execution Details**:
  - Decoded instructions.
  - Binary encoded instructions.
  - Total clock cycles and CPI (Cycles Per Instruction).
